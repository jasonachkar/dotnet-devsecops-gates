# =============================================================================
# security.yml — Security Scanning Workflow (GitHub Actions)
# =============================================================================
# This workflow runs three independent security scanning jobs:
#
#   1. CodeQL (SAST) — Static Application Security Testing for C#
#      Analyzes source code for vulnerability patterns like SQL injection,
#      open redirects, XSS, insecure deserialization, etc.
#
#   2. Gitleaks — Secrets scanning of the current working tree (dir mode)
#      Detects API keys, tokens, passwords, and custom patterns defined
#      in .gitleaks.toml. Runs in "dir" mode (not git-history mode) to
#      avoid false positives from old commits. SARIF results are uploaded
#      to the GitHub Security tab.
#
#   3. Dependency Review — PR-only check for vulnerable dependencies
#      Compares the dependency diff between the PR and base branch,
#      flagging any newly introduced packages with known CVEs.
#
# All three jobs run independently in parallel for faster feedback.
#
# NOTE: Code Scanning UI and Dependency Review features require the repo
# to be public, or require GitHub Advanced Security for private repos.

  # Job 1: CodeQL — Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  # ===========================================================================
  # CodeQL builds the C# project, creates a database of code flows, and
  # runs security queries against it. Results appear in GitHub Security tab.
  #
  # Using v4 of codeql-action (latest stable).
  # Query suite: security-extended — includes standard security queries plus
  # additional coverage for common vulnerability patterns beyond the defaults.

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Initialize CodeQL — sets up the analysis database for C#.
      # This must run BEFORE the build step so CodeQL can intercept
      # the compilation and capture code flow information.

  # ===========================================================================
  # Job 2: Gitleaks — Secrets Scanning (dir mode)
  # ===========================================================================
  # Scans the CURRENT WORKING TREE (not git history) for leaked secrets.
  # Uses "dir" mode instead of "git" mode to avoid false positives from
  # old commits that may have contained demo patterns.
  #
  # Custom rules are defined in .gitleaks.toml at the repo root.
  # The demo rule detects lines starting with the demo token followed
  # by an equals sign — only fires on actual leak files, not prose.
  #
  # Pattern:
  #   1. Run gitleaks with continue-on-error (so SARIF uploads even on findings)
  #   2. Upload SARIF to GitHub Security tab (always)
  #   3. Fail the job if gitleaks found leaks (check step outcome)
  #
  # No license key needed — uses the official container image directly.

      # Run gitleaks in "dir" mode — scans working tree only (no git history).
      # Pinned to a specific container tag for reproducibility.
      # --report-format sarif outputs results for GitHub Security tab.
      # continue-on-error: true ensures the SARIF upload step runs even
      # when leaks are found (gitleaks exits non-zero on findings).
