# dependabot.yml — Automated Dependency Updates
# =============================================================================
# Dependabot opens PRs to update dependencies on a weekly schedule.
# This keeps the repo current with security patches and version updates.
#
# Two ecosystems are monitored:
#   1. github-actions — updates action versions in .github/workflows/*.yml
#      (e.g., actions/checkout@v4 -> v5 when available)
#   2. nuget — updates NuGet package versions in Directory.Packages.props
#      (central package management — Dependabot understands this format)
#
# PRs are created automatically. CI and Security workflows run on each PR,
# so you get full gate coverage before merging any dependency update.
